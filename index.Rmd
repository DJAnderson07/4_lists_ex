## Lists versus other data structures

* To date, we have mostly worked with data frames
	+ type of list
* Each column of a data frame is (almost always) an atomic vector of a specific type
	+ double
	+ integer
	+ character
	+ logical
* All elements within an atomic vector must be of the same type (implicit coercion). 
* Lists are vectors (not atomic) where every element can be of a different type, including other lists.

## Contrasting lists and atomic vectors

*** =left

# Lists
```{r list1}
list("a", 4.35, TRUE, 7L)
```

*** =right

# Vectors
(implicit coercion)

```{r vec1}
c("a", 4.35, TRUE, 7L)
c(4.35, TRUE, 7L)
```

----
## Quick aside

* Logical vectors can be coerced to binary numeric (0/1) and vice versa.
* This feature can make a really handy way to investigate missing data.

```{r miss_data_sum}
some_data <- c(12, 15, NA, 5, 7, NA, NA, 18, 6, NA)
sum(is.na(some_data))
```

---- &twocol
## Lists
Note that the length of list elements can all be different.

*** =left

```{r, list3}
l <- list(
	c("a", "b", "c"),
	1:5,
	rep(c(T,F), 7),
	rnorm(3, 100, 25)
		  )
```

*** =right

```{r print_list3}
l
```

----
## Lists returned by functions
* Many functions return a list of objects. This is because lists are a great way to store a lot of varied information. For example: `lm`.

```{r}
mod <- lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars)
str(mod)
```

----
You can access the elements through the list

```{r}
mod$coefficients
```

```{r extract_resids}
mod$residuals
```

----
## Extractors

Often with functions there are more efficient methods for extracting model output.

```{r}
coef(mod)
```

In this case the methods are roughly equivalent, but sometimes it can make a
  difference (*ltm* example)

----
## Other functions will transform data into lists

```{r}
cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
str(cyls)
```

----
## More on lists
* Note that the previous slide looked like a nested list (list inside a list). 
  This is because data frames are lists, where each element of the list is a
  vector of the same length.
* lists are tremendously useful and flexible, and can lead to massive jumps in efficiency when combined with loops
  	+ Often want to loop through a list and apply a function to each element
  	  of the list.

## Lists and data frames

*** =left

```{r}
l <- list(
	lets = letters[1:5],
	ints = 9:5,
	dbl = rnorm(5, 12, 0.75)
	)
l
```

*** =right

```{r as_dframe}
as.data.frame(l)
```

--- &twocol
# Alternative

*** =left

```{r dframe}
dframe <- data.frame(
	lets = letters[1:5],
	ints = 9:5,
	dbl = rnorm(5, 12, 0.75)
	)
dframe
```

*** =right

```{r dframe_lst}
as.list(dframe)
```

# Brief introduction to *purrr*
![purr](assets/img/purrr.png)

----
## *purrr*
* As everything with the tidyverse, base equivalents exist
* *purrr* (note three r's) is pipe (`%>%`) friendly
* Has nice parallelization features. 
* We'll focus today on `map` and friends, which is the primary function from the package.
* Generally used with lists (for me at least), but can work with any type of vector.

----
## Data
*mtcars* dataset split by cylinder

```{r mtcars_split}
cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
str(cyls)
```

----
## `map` basic usage

```{r, map_lm}
library(purrr)
map(cyls, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)) 
```

---
## Basic usage

```{r map_basics, eval = FALSE}
map(LIST, FUN, ...)
```
* LIST = list to loop through
* FUN = Function to loop through the list
* ... Other arguments passed to the function

---
## Different ways to specify functions 

The below are equivalent

```{r map_syntax, eval = FALSE}
map(cyls, function(x) lm(hp ~ mpg, data = x))
map(cyls, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)) 
```

If we want to extract something from each element of the list, and the that something is named, we can also just supply that name as a string. 

```{r map_string}
models <- map(cyls, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)) 
map(models, "coefficients")
```

---- &twocol
## Different versions of map

*** =left

If we call a single function, just list it.

```{r diff_maps1}
lst <- list(first = 1:3, 
			second = 80:100, 
			third = -2:4)

map(lst, mean)
```

`map` will alway return a list. Other variants will return other output.

*** =right


```{r dif_maps2}
map_df(lst, mean)
map_dbl(lst, mean)
map_chr(lst, mean)
```

----
## Putting them together

```{r linking_funs1, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
map(cyls, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)) %>% 
	map_df(coef) %>% 
	mutate(param = c("intercept", "slope")) %>% 
	gather(cyl, val, -4) %>% 
	spread(param, val)
```

----
## Alternatively: *broom*

```{r broom1}
library(broom)
map(cyls, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)) %>% 
	map_df(tidy)
```

--- &twocol
## More complex versions of `map`
* `map2` iterates over two lists (or any type of vector) in parallel
* `pmap` 

# Calculate differences in means

(spacing added just for clarity)

*** =left

```{r map2_1_echo, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(222)
map2(list(rnorm(100), 
		  rnorm(100),
		  rnorm(100)),

	 list(rnorm(100, 0.5), 
	 	  rnorm(100, 1), 
	 	  rnorm(100, 0.2)), 

	~mean(.x) - mean(.y))
```

*** =right

```{r map2_1_eval, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(222)
map2(list(rnorm(100), 
		  rnorm(100),
		  rnorm(100)),

	 list(rnorm(100, 0.5), 
	 	  rnorm(100, 1), 
	 	  rnorm(100, 0.2)), 

	~mean(.x) - mean(.y))
```

----
## Calculate effect sizes

```{r map2_2}
set.seed(222)
map2_dbl(list(rnorm(100), 
		  	  rnorm(100),
		  	  rnorm(100)),

	 	 list(rnorm(100, 0.5), 
	 	  	  rnorm(100, 1), 
	 	  	  rnorm(100, 0.2)),

	~ (mean(.x) - mean(.y)) / sqrt(
		((length(.x) - 1) * sd(.x) +  (length(.y) - 1) * sd(.y)) /
					 ((length(.x) + length(.y)) - 2)))
```

----
## `pmap`
* We won't focus on `pmap` today, but it's worth noting that the syntax is slightly different. You supply one (possibly nested) list with all the arguments to the function, and then supply the function.

For example, setup a simulation with different sample sizes, means, and standard deviations. (In this particular example we could )

```{r pmap}
n <- list(50, 100, 250, 500)
mu <- list(10, 15, 10, 15)
stdev <- list(1, 1, 2, 2)

sim_data <- pmap(list(n, mu, stdev), rnorm)
str(sim_data)
```

----
## Use `map` to check simulation
* *sim_data* is a list, so we can loop through it
* We saw on the previous slide that the sample sizes were correct. What about the means and standard deviations?

```{r check_pmap_sim}
map_dbl(sim_data, mean)
map_dbl(sim_data, sd)
```

---
## Nesting data frames
Rather than splitting data frames (as we did before), it can often be helpful to `nest()` them instead. The reason you would want to nest a data frame is for similar reasons to wanting to split it.

For example,

```{r nest1}
nested <- mtcars %>% 
	group_by(cyl) %>% 
	nest()
nested
```

----
## List columns
In the previous example:
* Data are split by cylinder, just as before
* The list of data are then stored into a list column in a data frame
* Each "cell" in the list column contains all the data for that corresponding 
  row in the data frame (cylinder).
* In some ways this is a bit odd, but it can help us stay organized.

---
```{r show_nest}
nested$data
```

---
## Fit multiple models

```{r nest_model}
nested <- nested %>% 
	mutate(m1_mpg = map(data, ~lm(hp ~ mpg, data = .)),
		   m2_mpg_disp = map(data, ~lm(hp ~ mpg + disp, data = .)))
nested
```

---
## See models for *mpg* and *disp*

```{r mpg_disp_mod}
nested$m2_mpg_disp
```

----
## Summary of models for *mpg* and *disp*

```{r mpg_disp_mod_summary1}
map(nested$m2_mpg_disp, summary)
```

----
## For the `$` averse

```{r mpg_disp_mod_summary2}
nested %>% 
	transmute(smry = map(m2_mpg_disp, summary)) %>% 
	flatten()
```

----
## Another alternative

```{r mpg_disp_mod_summary3}
nested %>% 
	select(m2_mpg_disp) %>% 
	map(map, summary)
```

---
## Compare Models

```{r anovas}
nested <- nested %>% 
	mutate(m12_comp = map2(m1_mpg, m2_mpg_disp, anova), 
		   p = map(m12_comp, "Pr(>F)"),
		   p = map_dbl(p, `[`, 2))
nested
```

----
## Extract all coefficients

```{r broom2}
coefs <- nested %>% 
	select(3:4) %>% 
	map(map_df, tidy) 
coefs
```

---
## Next steps
From here we could go on to plotting, etc., instead, let's look at a full, applied example that uses some of these topics.

# Context
* Evaluating intervention response through "checkpoints"
* Only concerning if students do not receive full credit at each checkpoint
* Evaluate patterns of checkpoint response to see if we can identify different types of non-responders

# Analysis
* Examine means at pre- and post-test on various measures of mathematics for student groups (according to their patterns of response)
* Examine residual gains by groups
* Ask Lina if you have more questions, she's the guru here.
